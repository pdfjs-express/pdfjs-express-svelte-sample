# PDF.js Express Svelte Example

[PDF.js Express](https://pdfjs.express/) is a powerful JavaScript-based PDF Library that leverages PDF.js and adds additional features such as annotations, form support, and digitial signatures. It provides a slick out-of-the-box responsive UI that interacts with the core library to view, annotate and manipulate PDFs that can be embedded into any web project.

This repo is specifically designed for any users interested in integrating Express into [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) project. This project was generated using the [Svelte degit](https://svelte.dev/blog/the-easiest-way-to-get-started#2_Use_degit) template.
